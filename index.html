<p>Here are some examples of HTML maps built with plotly express. Code in the openspace-rvdata Git repository.</p>
<p><a href="notebooks/plots/RV Cruises">A Gantt chart of all cruises in the R2R database.</a> </p>
<p><a href="notebooks/plots/RV Cruises by Waterbody">A Gantt chart of all cruises in the R2R database, colormapped by what body of water they were in.</a> </p>
<p><a href="notebooks/plots/Fe Cruises">A Gantt chart of all cruises in the R2R database that include the word "Iron" in the title.</a> (Less of an eye chart than some of the other examples here.) </p>
